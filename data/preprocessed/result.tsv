A metal ion chelator in the injection is ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium or ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid calcium sodium ; small white spots and an ibuprofen injection of which the number of visible foreign matters is remarkably reduced can be obtained by controlling the weight percentage of the metal ion chelator to be 0.05-0.48 percent ; and when an internal coating material of the injection is neutral borosilicate glass ampoule , an ibuprofen injection with stable quality and favorable clarity can be obtained ; and the problem that the visible foreign matters are easily generated in the large-scale industrial production of the domestic ibuprofen injection at present is solved .
