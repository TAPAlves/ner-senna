The invention relates to a cefaclor film-controlled slow-release pellet capsule .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
A slow-release film of the cefaclor film-controlled slow-release pellet utilizes a mixture of aqueous dispersion Eurdragit RL 30D and Eurdragit RS 30D as a film-formation material , wherein a weight ratio of Eurdragit RL 30D to Eurdragit RS 30D in the mixture is 4 : 1 .

A pellet core of the cefaclor film-controlled slow-release pellet contains sodium carboxymethyl starch having high expansibility , and also contains pharmaceutically-acceptable common excipients for the slow-release pellet , wherein preferably , the excipients comprise microcrystalline cellulose and lactose , and the pellet core comprises 5 to 20wt % of the sodium carboxymethyl starch .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
The slow-release film comprises the mixture of Eurdragit RL 30D and Eurdragit RS 30D , triethyl citrate as a plasticizer , and talcum powder as an antiplastering aid , wherein preferably , a ratio of Eurdragit RL 30D to Eurdragit RS 30D to triethyl citrate to talcum powder is 24 : 6 : 2 : 4 and a film weight increasing ratio is in a range of 23 to 40 % .

The cefaclor film-controlled slow-release pellet comprises the pellet core containing sodium carboxymethyl starch having high water expansibility and thus after absorbing water , the cefaclor film-controlled slow-release pellet obviously expands so that the slow-release film is stretched ; the thickness of the slow-release film is reduced ; the water-permeable micropore size is increased ; and permeability is improved and the permeability reduction caused by film aging is counteracted .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
Therefore , in middle and later stages , the cefaclor film-controlled slow-release pellet release rate is basically constant ; in the last stage , residues are less ; and stable release performances can be kept in the period of validity .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

The invention relates to application of glaucocalyxin A and particularly relates to application of glaucocalyxin A in preparation of anticoagulation medicaments .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
The glaucocalyxin A can be used for remarkably prolonging the capillary coagulation time and tail tip bleeding time of mice , and remarkably prolonging the thrombin time ( TT ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) , activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) and plasma recalcification time ( PRT ) of the mice .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
The results of in-vivo-administration anticoagulation experiments prove that the glaucocalyxin A can be used for remarkably prolonging the APTT and PRT of the mice , thereby prompting that the glaucocalyxin A can be used for inhibiting the generation of fibrin by disturbing intrinsic coagulation factor activity ; and the remarkable prolonging of the TT proves the inhibition of transformation from fibrinogen to fibrin .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
The results of the in-vivo-administration anticoagulation experiments also prove that the glaucocalyxin A has a certain inhibition effect on extrinsic coagulation pathways since the glaucocalyxin A can be used for remarkably prolonging the PT .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
The results of in-vitro experiments prove that the glaucocalyxin A can be used for remarkably prolonging the APTT , PT and PRT , but has no obvious effects on the PT , thereby proving that the glaucocalyxin A realizes the anticoagulation effect in vitro mainly through inhibiting intrinsic coagulation pathways .
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
